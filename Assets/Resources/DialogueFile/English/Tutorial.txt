Oh, finally you came.;???;Library
I'm the caretaker here. Librarian, let's start the adventure to help the book world.;LibrarianLeft;
Oh, you ask where is this?;LibrarianLeft;
This is the world of books, "Rark" the library, Let's go adventure.;LibrarianLeft;
Hmm, you know this is where, what the matter ?;LibrarianLeft;
Ok, I can will explain more specific than this.;LibrarianLeft;
As I told, this is the world of books, but the books here are not complete.;LibrarianLeft;
I have to invite you. To help me complete the book.;LibrarianLeft;
It's too much books, I can not do it alone.;LibrarianLeft;
The way to complete it is very simple. You just go on adventure in that book. Until finally settled.;LibrarianLeft;
But you do not have to do it yourself. Just control the character in the book only.;LibrarianLeft;
And do not worry. The characters do not know, they only move with the role.;LibrarianLeft;
Ah, you seem to understand the situation. More then I have to go.;LibrarianLeft;
...You still seem have some doubts. Just be right, I will teach you.;LibrarianLeft;
